# `seed-fhir` â€” FHIR Server

This project is an application skeleton for a FHIR backend application. 

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the `seed-fhir` repository and install the dependencies:

### Prerequisites

You will need [OpenJDK 11][jdk-download] and [Maven][maven].

### Clone `seed-fhir`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/systelab/seed-fhir.git
cd seed-fhir
```

### Install Dependencies

In order to install the dependencies and generate the Uber jar you must run:

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Run

To launch the server, simply run with java -jar the generated jar file.

curl http://localhost:8080/fhir/Patient/1
```

## Docker

### Build docker image

There is an Automated Build Task in Docker Cloud in order to build the Docker Image. 
This task, triggers a new build with every git push to your source code repository to create a 'latest' image.
There is another build rule to trigger a new tag and create a 'version-x.y.z' image

You can always manually create the image with the following command:

```bash
docker build -t systelab/seed-fhir . 
```

### Run the container

```bash
docker run -p 8443:8443 -p 8080:8080 systelab/seed-fhir
```

The app will be available at http://localhost:8080/fhir
